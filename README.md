TIY Final App - Brewery Bee

This is my final project as a student for The Iron Yard in St. Petersburg, FL.
Brewery Bee is an online app that helps the user find local beweries and beers.

I wanted to keep the look clean but still fun so I chose a background image and overlayed the information above the image
with an opacity so that the image could still come through.
